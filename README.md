# Data Model for City Councils Decision-Making Data

## Repository Structure
- `schema.json` - generic data model designed as a JSON schema (in English)
- `README-CZ.md` and `schema-CZ.json` - files containing the same content in Czech

## Data Model
- the model has four separate sub-parts:
  - basic data on municipal self-government,
  - political entities (parties or their coalitions),
  - representatives (members of the council),
  - and councils, i. e. information about the councils for terms, including individual sittings and voting topic with votes.
